\par{I am a Lecturer in the School of Business at the Faculty of Humanities at the Universidad Mayor, Chile. Moreover, I work in research projects funded by the Chilean National Agency of Research and Development, and I am a member of the editorial team at the RGP journal. 

I hold an MA (1st) in Political Science from the Institute for Public Affairs at the Universidad de Chile. My thesis was supported by the Chilean Formation of Advanced Human Capital Programme and focused on the Chilean congress's legislative networks during the democratic post-transition. Prior to starting my MA, I earned a BA (1st) and a BPS (1st) in Public Administration from the Universidad de Santiago, where I worked as a teaching and research assistant.

I am interested in technocracy in Latin America, public policies and legislative processes, social network analysis, and mixed methods.}\\
