\par{I hold an MA (1st) in Political Science from the Institute for Public Affairs at the Universidad de Chile. My thesis was supported by the Chilean Formation of Advanced Human Capital Programme and focuses on the legislative networks in the Chilean congress during the democratic post-transition. Prior to starting my MA, I earned a BA (1st) in Public Administration from the Universidad de Santiago, where I was a teaching assistant.

Currently, I work as both research and editorial assistant in research projects funded by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) and at the RGP journal, respectively. I am interested in technocracy and legislative studies in Latin American, social network analysis, and mixed methods.}\\
